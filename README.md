# Audio and Video Lab

A simple HTML project demonstrating how to embed and control audio and video elements in a webpage using standard HTML5 tags.

## Overview

This project provides a lightweight example of how to integrate media into a webpage.  
It includes:
- An instructional video explaining the JavaScript `map()` method.
- A looping audio sample titled “Sailing Away.”

Both media elements use external sources and built-in HTML attributes to provide playback controls and responsive layout behavior.

## Features

- HTML5 `<video>` element with `controls` and custom width  
- HTML5 `<audio>` element with `controls` and `loop`  
- Responsive meta viewport for mobile devices  
- External CDN media sources for instant access

<video src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/What is the map method and how does it work.mp4" controls width="640"></video>
